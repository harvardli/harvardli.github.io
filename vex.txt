For the past seven years, VEX Robotics has been a massive part of my life, teaching me about teamwork, problem-solving, and persevering through challenges. It all began in 2018 when I joined the Shanghai Ruiguan Robotics Club, unaware it would ignite a passion for building and problem-solving.

Initially, I was completely new, fumbling with tools and baffled by how to make a robot function. Our first competition, the 2018-2019 VEX Robotics City Elite in Shanghai, was tough. Our robot barely worked, and my inexperience as a driver didn’t help, so we finished near the bottom. Instead of giving up, I felt motivated. I spent hours after school in the club, tinkering with designs and learning about drivetrains and coding. Those late nights surrounded by tools and code taught me that mistakes are just part of improving.

Over time, I took on larger roles. By 2019, I was a programmer, writing driver control code and creating paths for the autonomous period. We faced plenty of challenges, though. In 2020, we realised our autonomous mode was unstable because we relied on time-based control, which was frustrating. I began learning new methods like on/off control and PID controllers, which I later explored in my essay on quadcopters. That experience taught me to think on my feet and find solutions. We also noticed in games with coloured elements, like "Change Up" (2020-2021) and "High Stakes" (2024-2025), that drivers struggled to avoid opposing colours. To address this, we implemented a colour-sorting algorithm using VEX’s optical sensor, making our robot more efficient.

In 2024, my team competed in the 2023-2024 VEX Robotics World Championship (Middle School Division), placing 6th in our division’s qualification matches. We allied with a strong team, fought through the elimination rounds, and won our division championship. Unfortunately, we lost our first match in the Dome—where division champions compete for the world title—by just 2 points. In 2025, we entered the 2024-2025 VEX Robotics World Championship (High School Division) but placed 33rd in qualifications. Luck was on our side when a solid team chose us as allies, leading to another division championship. Once again, though, we fell short in the Dome, losing our first match by 2 points, marking the end of my seven-year VEX Robotics journey.

Robotics also showed me the value of community. Mentoring younger teammates was as rewarding as any victory. Watching a past teammate grow into a confident leader reminded me of my own progress and the mentors who guided me. I also connected with teams from China, the United States, Canada, Senegal, and even the Northern Mariana Islands—one of my favourite places—sharing tips and building friendships despite the competition.

Seven years of VEX Robotics gave me more than awards or impressive projects. It taught me to tackle problems, collaborate with others, and view mistakes as opportunities to grow and will definitely be an unforgettable part of my life.
